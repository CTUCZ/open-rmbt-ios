        <p>
            In the case of high demand or a high number of tests, loop mode tests may be rejected by the test system in order to avoid overload. 
            It should be noted that the loop mode is intended (only) for usage within the EU and EFTA states.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that the loop mode consumes a huge amount of data. With high-speed connections 10 tests can consume 1 GB or more. 
            Therefore it is highly recommended to run the loop mode only with a true flat rate tariff where additional traffic des not generate additional costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The loop mode also consumes a lot of battery power. Between the loop tests, the loop mode keeps GPS and the display active, thus the battery is drained much faster
            than in standbymode. 
            In addition, tests also consume power. Therefore the loop mode should be used only if an extended power supply is available.
