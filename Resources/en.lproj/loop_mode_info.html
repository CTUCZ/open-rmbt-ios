            The loop mode allows the automatic repetition of RTR-NetTest.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first test will
            start immediately after the loop mode has been initiated. Further tests will be
            started after either the waiting time (default 30 minutes) has elapsed or the
            configured distance (default 250 meters) has been covered. These values can be
            changed under “Settings”. Tests will be performed until the configured number of
            tests (default 10 tests) has been reached. The loop mode is automatically terminated
            after 2 days. The loop mode can be stopped at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            It needs to be explicitly pointed out that due to the loop mode it cannot be
            excluded that the tester is identified.
