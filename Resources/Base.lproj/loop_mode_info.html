            The loop mode allows the automatic repetition of CTU-NetTest.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first test starts right after activation of the loop mode; further tests are carried out when the waiting time has elapsed (default value is 15 minutes). 
            These values can be changed under “Settings”. Tests will be performed until the configured number of tests (default 6 tests) has been reached. 
            The loop mode is automatically terminated after 2 days. The loop mode can be stopped at any time.
